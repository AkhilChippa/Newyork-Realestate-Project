Comprehensive Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling Using Python
Project Summary
The primary objective of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of the given dataset, extract meaningful insights, engineer new features, and build a predictive model to achieve the best possible performance. The project involves three main tasks: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building with hyperparameter tuning.

Tools and Libraries Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
Tasks and Steps
Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Loading the Data: Imported the dataset using pandas and inspected the first few rows with df.head().
Data Cleaning: Identified and handled missing values, detected and treated outliers, checked for data inconsistencies.
Data Visualization: Created histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, pair plots, and heatmaps to understand data distribution and relationships.
Task 2: Feature Engineering
Derived Features: Created new features based on domain knowledge and generated interaction and polynomial features.
Feature Transformation: Applied scaling and normalization to continuous variables, performed one-hot encoding and label encoding for categorical variables.
Feature Selection: Used correlation analysis, feature importance, and recursive feature elimination to select relevant features.
Task 3: Model Building and Hyperparameter Tuning
Model Selection: Considered Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Model Training: Split the data into training and testing sets, trained multiple models.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Used Grid Search and Random Search with cross-validation to find optimal hyperparameters.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.
